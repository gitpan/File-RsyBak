=head1 NAME

rsybak - Backup files/directories with histories, using rsync

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.23 of rsybak (from Perl distribution File-RsyBak), released on 2015-01-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % rsybak [options] <source> <target>

Examples:

 % rsybak /home/jajang/mydata /backup/jajang/mydata

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--extra-dir>

Whether to force creation of source directory in target.

If set to 1, then backup(source => '/a', target => '/backup/a') will create
another 'a' directory in target, i.e. /backup/a/current/a. Otherwise, contents
of a/ will be directly copied under /backup/a/current/.

Will always be set to 1 if source is more than one, but default to 0 if source
is a single directory. You can set this to 1 to so that behaviour when there is
a single source is the same as behaviour when there are several sources.


=item B<--extra-rsync-opts-json>=I<s>

Pass extra options to rsync command (JSON-encoded).

See C<--extra-rsync-opts>.

=item B<--extra-rsync-opts-yaml>=I<s>

Pass extra options to rsync command (YAML-encoded).

See C<--extra-rsync-opts>.

=item B<--extra-rsync-opts>=I<s@>

Pass extra options to rsync command.

Extra options to pass to rsync command when doing backup. Note that the options
will be shell quoted, , so you should pass it unquoted, e.g. ['--exclude',
'/Program Files'].

=item B<--histories>=I<s@>

Default value:

 [-7, 4, 3]

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C rsybak rsybak

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete rsybak 'p/*/`rsybak`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
