=head2 How to see more verbose/debugging output?

B<rsybak> uses L<Log::Any::App>. You can customize logging levels using a
variety of ways, e.g. environment variable:

 % TRACE=1 rsybak ...

By default it also writes log to ~/rsybak.log. You can disable this using:

 % FILE_LOG_LEVEL=off rsybak ...

Or you can customize the level using:

 % FILE_QUIET=1 rsybak ...

See the documentation for Log::Any::App for more details.
